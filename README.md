## Repository Branches

- `main` – template for creating new branches
- `dev` – examples from training sessions
- `name` – individual student branches (replace "name" with your name)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or 21
- Git
- IDE (IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse recommended)

### Setting Up the Project

#### How to create a new branch:

1. Create a folder on your local drive 📂
2. Open Command Prompt, Git Bash, or the **terminal** in your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse) 💻
3. Clone the repository 🔗:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/UA-4724-Java-Fundamentals/UA-4724-Java-Fundamentals.git
    ```
4. Navigate to your directory:
    ```bash
    cd UA-4724-Java-Fundamentals
    ```
5. Check the active branch:
    ```bash
    git branch
    ```
6. Create your own branch:
    ```bash
    git branch yourName
    ```
7. Switch to the new branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout yourName
    ```
8. Open the project in your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse) and start writing code.

### Running Tests
This project uses JUnit 5 for testing. To run the tests:

1. Using Maven:
    ```bash
    ./mvnw test
    ```
    or on Windows:
    ```bash
    mvnw.cmd test
    ```

2. Using your IDE:
   - Right-click on the test file or test directory
   - Select "Run Tests" or equivalent option in your IDE

## Contributing
1. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
2. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
3. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
4. Open a Pull Request

---
> **Note**: All the commands above can be run directly from the terminal in your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse) for convenience. ✨
